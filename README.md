# Pagani_Hypertension_2017

R code to generate computational results presented in Pagani et al., Hypertension, 2017.

Three analyses are performed:
1) fitting of exponential and hyper-expoenential demographic model parameters
2) computation of time to the most recent common ancestor given haplotype data
3) forward simulations to estimate an allele frequency given a demographic model

Summary: Genome-wide analysis supplemented by coalescent analysis allowed us to infer the evolutionary history of a LS mutation shared by three kindreds and predict the approximate number of undiagnosed cases living in the area of origin.
